The abstracts ofaccepted posters will be published in book form and will beavailable at the meeting and subsequently posted on the web. Thefollowing instructions are intended to maximize space available toauthors while ensuring agreeable and consistent appearance,efficient handling and timely publication. Final posters may, ofcourse, be in any format, as long as they fit onto a board of 1 mheight and 1 m width. Acceptance of an abstract is conditional on atleast one of its authors preregistering for RECOMB electronicallybefore February 19, 2006 (see {\tt http://recomb06.dei.unipd.it/}).Abstracts must be received by January 20, 2006; authors will benotified about acceptance before February 3, 2006. Files we cannotopen or which do not satisfy the format instructions will bereturned.\section{\large Software and files.}The abstract, written in clear andreasonably grammatical English, must be prepared in exactly the same format asthe example in the templates, and should fit on two pages, everything included,after conversion to pdf.If at all possible, use LaTeX 2e article document class, with all the defaultoptions, and with a minimum of other packages and other files.  Download thetemplate file provided. To conserve space, do not split the abstract into manysmall sections.For those for whom LaTeX is impossible, use Word or other easily translatableword-processing software.  Download the Word template and substitute your owntext, titles and headings, conserving the same fonts, sizes and styles.The output from LaTeX processing or the Word document fileshould be converted to a pdf format for final web submission.Make sure that the extra information that youprovide during the web submission (title, authors, keywords, etc) is in agreement with the content of the abstract.\section{\large Figures and tables.}Figures must be created with the standard LaTeX figure environment or included asan eps file. Tables should be created with the table environment.Make sure figures are readable and not too crowded. Do not usetype sizes smaller than {\bf footnotesize} in figures and tables.  No colorplease.Figures in Word must be incorporated in the abstract before converting to pdf.In any case, they must appear properly positioned in the final pdf file.Use the general format in Figure \ref{circles}, if possible.\begin{figure}[h]\begin{center}\footnotesize\begin{picture}(300,60)\put(30,20){\circle{40}}\thicklines\qbezier(36,40)(45,38)(50,26)\put(120,20){\vector(1,0){50}}\thinlines\put(60,35){turn of length $f$}\put(60,35){\vector(-2,-1){10}}\put(20,45){\line(1,-2){5}}\put(20,45){\line(1,-2){5}}\put(28,45){$d$}\put(40,33){\line(1,2){5}}\put(240,20){\circle{40}}\put(230,45){\line(1,-2){5}}\put(255,25){\line(1,0){10}}\put(248,41){$d'$}\end{picture}\end{center}\caption{\footnotesize Effect of turns of length $f$ on the distance from $d$ to$d'$}\label{circles}\end{figure}Tabular displays should have the general format of Table \ref{turns}, ifpossible.\begin{table}[h]\begin{center} {\footnotesize\begin{tabular}{|c|cc|cc|cc|cc|}\hline & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{$x=10.3$} & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{$x=10.5$} &\multicolumn{2}{c|}{$x=21.7$} & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{$x=22.8$} \\$q$  & \multicolumn{1}{c}{gmt} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{jfk} &\multicolumn{1}{c}{fbi} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{mac} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{fax} &\multicolumn{1}{c|}{era} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{ibm} &\multicolumn{1}{c|}{pdf}\\\hline$a/20$ &     117.01 & 117.02  &   318.31 & 318.27  &   29.83 & 29.85    & 36.35& 36.40 \\$d/40$  &     338.88 & 338.03  &   53.34 & 53.31  &  97.29 & 67.24 &   26.74 &126.52 \\$5e$ &     246.58 & 246.50  &   47.57 & 47.57  &  24.28 & 24.89 &   55.54 &155.26 \\$7f$    &     157.64 & 157.54  &   36.83 & 36.83  &  38.80 & 38.02 &   72.63 &172.60 \\$2g/3$   &     58.08 & 58.05  &   27.35 & 27.32  &  56.20 & 56.23 &   95.47 &195.49 \\$\lceil \log h \rceil h^2$    &     18.99 & 18.99  &   99.00 & 98.99  &  58.94 &158.99 &   98.99 & 98.99 \\\hline m.t. &     4.6 &  5.1 &     3.8 &  4.1 &     2.2 & 1.9  &   3.6 &  3.7 \\\hline\end{tabular} }\end{center}\caption{\footnotesize Number of turns and distance between top and bottom.}\label{turns}\end{table}\section{\large References and bibliography.}Use the styles exemplified by \cite{HB98}, \cite{CA}, \cite{MSW00} and\cite{Rei91} below.
